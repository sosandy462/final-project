    Sandy Younan was born and raised in San Diego, California where she spent most of her teen years playing tennis. She attended San Diego State University in pursuit of her Bachelor of Science degree in Foods and Nutrition in order to better understand how food can enhance one's performance and how food plays a key role in one's health. She completed her Dietetic Internship at Utah State University and is currently practicing as a Registered Dieitian as an Outpatient Dietitian.

    While at San Diego State University, Sandy sought to become more involved on campus. She joined the Student Nutrition Organization (SNO) and was an active member for the first year before holding an executive officer for two years. The following year, Sandy became the Events Coordinator, where she organized and coordinated events that exposed student members to different areas in the field of nutrition while also giving back to the community at the same time. Sandy enjoyed her involvement in SNO so much that she decided to run for an officer position once more the following year. Sandy was voted in as Secretary in her last year of college. As Secretary, Sandy managed communication via email between the officers and members, monitored and kept track of the points that members received while attending events, recorded detailed meeting notes that were formulated in newsletter format and sent to over 200 members.

    Her interest in nutrition was sparked when her father was diagnosed with dyslipidemia. Her mother altered the meals that she made for Sandy's father and within a few months, her father's lab results displayed a significant improvement in blood lipids. Sandy wanted to understand the medical nutrition therapy behind her father's improved health. She hopes to utilize the knowledge that she gained to improve the well-being of clients/ patients and to educate them on the benefits of good nutritional practices.

        In her spare time, Sandy enjoys running, playing tennis and spending time with her large family. During the holidays, for example, Sandy celebrates with over 100 of her closest relatives. Ms. Younan plans on remaining in San Diego after she has completed her Dietetic Internship and pursuing a career in the field of nutrition.
